Who Am I?

- Not a hardcore quant: anthro PhD
- Starting using R when I was consulting so I could have a free option to replace Excel, SPSS, etc. Realized R was much more than that.
- Use R for descriptive stats, data visualization, creative reporting
- Realized the power of R and realized people are scared of it. Started RRU to offer training through online courses, training orgs, workshops, etc to help the rest of us learn R.

Problems:

- What if you need to redo report next year? 
- Lot of manual work > copy-paste errors

Remember this? You can do it all in one tool: RMarkdown

With RMarkdown, you can do all 4 steps in one document

- Get data

- Write report
- And you can repeat this process whenever you want
